# PowerBiVisualization
This repository contains work from a course I completed with Zakidata, where I learned and applied various concepts and tools in Power BI. The course consisted of four classes, and here I share and explain what each class covered. We created dashboards ranging from simple to more complex, culminating in a final project to apply the concepts learned.

The focus was on creating a series of Power BI dashboards, including ETL processes and analysis of different cases.

The first dashboard is a simple visualization where data from a Call Center dataset was cleaned and analyzed. This basic dataset was used to introduce foundational concepts in Power BI.

The second dashboard focuses on employee analysis conducted by a company's HR department. We used funnels, column charts, cards, filters, and tables to build the dashboard. This stage emphasized the importance of selecting the appropriate chart type for the information we wanted to visualize.

The third dashboard simulated a financial analysis for a travel store company. It involved linking several tables and adding elements to make the dashboard more attractive and dynamic. New features included geolocation maps and image-based filters.

The final section showcases the final project analysis. This project involved analyzing and visualizing road accidents. A PDF with instructions and tasks is attached.
